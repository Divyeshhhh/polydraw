# Usage

You must follow the installation instructions before proceeding.


## Run project

Navigate to the root directory of the project:

```bash
cd polydraw
```

Run the project:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.github.creme332.App
```

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, you can use an IDE with Maven configured to run the `App.java` file in the `src/main/java/com/github/creme332/App.java` folder. If you are using VS Code, install the [Extension Pack for Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-build#_maven) and use `F5` to run the project.

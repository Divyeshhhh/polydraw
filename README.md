# polydraw

An application for drawing shapes, inspired by GeoGebra Classic.

## Main features

- Scalable coordinate system with drag to move.
- Supports DDA and Bresenham line drawing algorithms
- Configurable line attributes (type, thickness, color)
- Draw polygons(regular and irregular)
- Configurable polygon attributes (border color, border thickness, fill color)
- Circle drawing using midpoint circle algorithm
- Animated transformations
- Ellipse drawing using midpoint ellipse algorithm
- Polygon fill using scan line algorithm
- Cohen Sutherland line clipping algorithm
- Drag and drop to move shapes
- Testing with JUnit
- Responsive sidebar

## Documentation

All documentation (installation guide, usage guide, ...) is available in the [`docs`](docs) folder.
